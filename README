This is a simple PHP widget that scrapes http://swtor.com/server-status for relevant server information.

See it in action here: http://cavalrycollective.com/swtor/serverStatus/

The status is cached locally by default for 5 minutes for speed purposes so we're not constantly hitting the sWTOR website.

Configuration:
1. Edit the swtor-server-widget.php file.
2. Modify the $serverName variable with whatever server name you'd like to get the status for. This should be in all lower case. Spaces are ok.
3. If you want, you can change the name the locally cached version of the html from the SWTOR site that we use to get our status. $cache_file_name
4. You can change the length of time to cache the status as well, measured in seconds. (300 = 5min) $cache_time_life.
5. Edit the swtor-widget.css file as you see fit and use the styles in your existing stylesheet, or just include this one into your site.
6. When you're all done, use include('yourFilePath/swtor-server-widget.php') on your page.


It generates some very simple HTML with some divs and classes so you can style as you see fit.

<div id="swtor-serverStatus-widget">
    <div class="container">
        <div class="name">Terentatek (PVP, East)</div>
        <div class="status UP"><strong>Status:</strong> UP</div>
	<div class="population"><strong>Population:</strong> Standard</div>
    </div>
</div>
